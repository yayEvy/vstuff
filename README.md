adds stuff to vs2 that i wanted to do because yea

features as of v0.0.3:

ropes (world to world, ship to ship, ship to world)

ship lead item, crafted with a lead surrounded by string, is consumed if in survival

ship lead cutter item, crafted with a lead and one red dye, shapeless, makes 4, breaks the lead you're looking at

constraints persist between restarts ig

recipes

survival compat

redstone magnets!


-- known issues --

if a ship to world constraint is set, and the ship is really really heavy, and you fling it, it can stretch the constraint which it shouldnt lol (why would you have a ship this heavy in survival tho? :clueless:)

ropes dont collide with stuff, so theyre not like vmod phys ropes, but i hope these will still be cool for people to use

if you make a world magnet, then a ship magnet, then activate them, they wont apply any forces until relogging

idk nothing else really besides rope rendering being a bit funky lmao





thats all lol
